# Project Title
 
Mini project 2: Dice statistics.
 
## Description
 
This is a script to plot some dice stats from my virtual tabletop I host for me and my friends. It plots my d20 rolls from our last several sessions to show how lucky or unlucky I have been. Graphs are plotted and saved in the 'charts/' folder.
 
## Getting Started
 
### Dependencies

Package requirements in the requirements.txt file. Requires Matplotlib, numpy, and pandas. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also requires the download of the data file, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jjDlTOlsD7m83C1Wg4dq9GzL9NuWW2UP?usp=drive_link). 

### Installing
 
In the same folder as 'main.py', create a directory titled 'data' and place the downloaded 'me-dice-stats-json-data.json' data file inside it.

### Executing program

```
python main.py
```
